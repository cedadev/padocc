# kerchunk-intake
A repository for creating intake catalogs and kerchunk files for multiple projects

- Added intake_* scripts to create local intake catalogs and auto generate kerchunk files from given directories
- Added tests/intake-upload-s3.py to adjust a small catalog and upload to s3 for access
- Added tests/intake-test-s3.py to access the catalog via s3 (requires change to intake-esm by forked version or manual adjustment)
