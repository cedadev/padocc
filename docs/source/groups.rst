Groups in PADOCC
================

The advantage of using PADOCC over other tools for creating cloud-format files is the scalability built-in, with parallelisation and deployment in mind.
PADOCC allows the creation of groups of datasets, each with N source files, that can be operated upon as a single entity. 
The operation can be applied to all or a subset of the datasets within the group with relative ease. Here we outline some basic functionality of the ``GroupOperation``. 
See the source documentation page for more detail.
