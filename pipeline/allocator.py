# Job Subset Allocation Script
# - Calculate Expected Utilisation for each Job (500 + Kerchunk Size*5 MB)

# First-Fit Bin Packing Algorithm
# - Sort Utilisations from largest to smallest
# - Bin Capacity is largest size rounded up to next memory cap (1, 2, 3, 4 GB)
#Â - Allocate item to first bin with space remaining
# - End with N bins (subsets) - write list of project codes for each subset to a separate file in proj_code_subsets/set_N.txt
# - Run array with number of subsets already set.

# Utilisation estimate is (total_chunks * 835) + 500 (MB)
